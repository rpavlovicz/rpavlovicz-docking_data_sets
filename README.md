# rpavlovicz-docking_data_sets
protein-protein and protein-ligand data sets used in Rosetta score function development

compressed files contain near native and decoy docking poses for protein-protein and 
protein-ligand data sets. these files are in the Rosetta silent file format.
the extract_pdbs application of Rosetta can be used to extract files in pdb format.
the params files required for interpreting small molecule topology are found in the
protein-ligand->params subfolder. example pdb extraction scripts are found in the
respective folders.
